# Route configuration
# Note: For wildcard routes on a specific domain, you need to either:
# 1. Use a Custom Domain (without paths): route = { pattern = "subdomain.yourdomain.com", custom_domain = true }
# 2. Use a zone-based route: route = { pattern = "yourdomain.com/path/*", zone_name = "yourdomain.com" }
#
# For now, removing routes - configure in Cloudflare Dashboard after deployment
# or add zone_name/zone_id for your domain
